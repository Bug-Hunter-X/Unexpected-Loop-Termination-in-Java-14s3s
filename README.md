This repository demonstrates a common coding error in Java: premature loop termination. The `bug.java` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.java` provides a corrected version. The issue arises from an unintended `return` statement inside a conditional block within a `while` loop. This causes the loop to terminate before its intended completion, leading to incorrect results. The solution replaces the `return` with a `continue` statement to address the error.
